# api_ga
Using API's from Google Analytics/Drive to extracting data unsampled
(unsampled reports).

### How work
The unsampled reports created are available to download on Google Drive.
An unsampled report is submitted to Google Analytics by APIs.
So, this report is processed by Google and then is available to download
on Google Drive.
To download this report from Google Drive also is used the APIs.
In both cases, I'm using the [google-api-client](https://github.com/google/google-api-python-client) (for python).

### Requirements
- python==2.7
- google-api-python-client==1.6.2
- httplib2==0.10.3
- oauth2client==4.1.0
- pyOpenSSL==16.2.0

_You can use the following command:_ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Authentication
To submit an unsampled report to Google Analytics the API is
authenticated using a service account.
To download an unsampled report from Google Drive the API is
authenticated using an user account.

For both cases, is necessary the JSON file (_client_secret.json_).
This file you can generate in Google API Console.

__These files were created for this specific project, but I can't share/
public them here because contains confidential data.__
